## 🎄 Introduction
You're probably already familiar with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), so let's skip that. This repository contains my solutions for this year, where my primary goal is to really dive deeper into Rust and become fluent in the language.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alex-croitoriu/Advent-of-Code-2024.git
```

### 2. Go to the project directory

```bash
cd Advent-of-Code-2024
```

### 3. Build and run

Running these commands will process the same input for both parts of the daily challenge and print out the two separate answers.

```bash
# Build and run the solution for the current day 
# (only makes sense during advent season)
make

# Build and run the solution for a specified day
# (will work for the range 01..25)
make DAY=01
```
